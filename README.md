# <Rock-Paper-Scissors>

## Description

This project is an age-old classic game that we know and love: Rock, Paper, Scissors. The game's players are You and the Computer, where you both battle it out to see who reaches 5 points first. The first player to get five points is named the victor, and has ultimate bragging rights. 

This is my first-ever project using Javascript. This game was creating using basic concepts in JS, including:

- event listeners
- functions
- variables
- if/then statements

The game interacts with the DOM using JS. The interface of the game was designed using HTML and CSS (flexbox). 

Lastly, I was able to utilize a git feature-based workflow.

Given that this project was my very first using programming logic and foundational JavaScript, it was incredibly challenging. I assume it was the equivalent of learning foundations of a language, and then writing a story in that language. Definitely intimdiating! Nevertheless, this project gave me the necessary exercise to solidify these new concepts.

I hope you enjoy!
